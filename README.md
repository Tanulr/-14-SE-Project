# #14-SE-Project
## A Poll Survey System
### Proposed project description
A website which allows users to host and fill out surveys. The website will have
multiple pages and a database where the user data is stored. The user can create
a new survey and host it on our website. Many form templates will be available
for the user to create forms. At the same time, the users can take up existing
surveys. Results and analysis done on past surveys will also be displayed on the
website.
